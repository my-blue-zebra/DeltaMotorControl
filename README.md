# DeltaMotorControl
#### A repository storing the development of the windows app made to control the motors of the 3D delta robot.
Orginal Files are in __"DeltaMotorControl.zip"__ however due to problems communicating with the Raspberry Pi this has been dropped. The files are kept as a legacy and hold the original code for the kinematics of the Delta robot.  
Current version of files are stored in __"DeltaMotorControl-PTSHE.zip"__ the suffix used denotes the usage of code from the *PulseTrainSerialHatExample.sln* code that can be accessed on the [Pulse Train Hat](http://pthat.com/index.php/commandexamples/)'s website.
